//
// An `unsafe` in Rust serves as a contract.
//
// When `unsafe` is marked on an item declaration, such as a function,
// a trait or so on, it declares a contract alongside it. However,
// the content of the contract cannot be expressed only by a single keyword.
// Hence, its your responsibility to manually state it in the `# Safety`
// section of your documentation comment on the item.
//
// When `unsafe` is marked on a code block enclosed by curly braces,
// it declares an observance of some contract, such as the validity of some
// pointer parameter, the ownership of some memory address. However, like
// the text above, you still need to state how the contract is observed in
// the comment on the code block.
//
// NOTE: All the comments are for the readability and the maintainability of
// your code, while the Rust compiler hands its trust of soundness of your
// code to yourself! If you cannot prove the memory safety and soundness of
// your own code, take a step back and use safe code instead!
//
// Execute `rustlings hint tests5` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.

/// The `address` must contain a mutable reference to a valid `u32` value.
unsafe fn modify_by_address(address: usize) {
    // TODO: Fill your safety notice of the code block below to match your
    // code's behavior and the contract of this function. You may use the
    // comment of the test below as your format reference.
    // unsafe {
    //     todo!("Your code goes here")
    // }

   let a =address as *mut u32;//将address转换为一个指向u32类型的可变指针，并将其赋值给变量a。这样，变量a就指向了一个u32类型的内存地址。
   let b= &mut *a;//通过*a解引用指针a，获取指针指向的值，然后使用&mut创建了一个对该值的可变引用，并将其赋值给变量b。这样，变量b就成为了指向u32类型值的可变引用。
